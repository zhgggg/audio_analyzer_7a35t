CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/freq_out2 input design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/freq_out2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/mag_sq0 input design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/mag_sq0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/mag_sq0 input design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/mag_sq0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/freq_out2 output design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/freq_out2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/freq_out2 multiplier stage design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/freq_out2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning

DSP design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/mag_sq0 multiplier stage design_1_i/fft_freq_meter_0/inst/mag_sq0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/adc_to_fft_buffer_0/inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/adc_to_fft_buffer_0/inst/mem_reg_0/ENARDEN (net: design_1_i/adc_to_fft_buffer_0/inst/adc_valid) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/ad7606_driver_0/inst/sample_valid_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
